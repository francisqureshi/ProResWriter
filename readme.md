# ProResWriter

Professional video post-production workflow automation tool for matching graded segments with original camera files (OCF) and creating broadcast-ready outputs.

## Overview

ProResWriter streamlines the post-production workflow by:
- **Importing** and analyzing media files with professional frame rate support
- **Linking** graded segments to their original camera files using timecode and metadata matching
- **Creating** blank rush proxies with timecode burn-in for review
- **Compositing** final outputs with frame-accurate positioning

## Core Features

### Import System
- Professional media analysis supporting all broadcast standards (23.976-120fps)
- Accurate frame counting for MXF, MOV, MP4 formats
- Drop-frame and non-drop-frame timecode detection
- Resolution and sample aspect ratio analysis

### Linking System  
- Intelligent parent-child OCF matching using:
  - Filename patterns and reel names
  - Timecode range validation
  - Resolution and frame rate matching
  - Confidence scoring system

### Blank Rush Creation
- Hardware-accelerated VideoToolbox ProRes encoding
- Professional timecode burn-in with TimecodeKit precision
- Source-matching frame rates and resolutions
- Broadcast-standard color space metadata (ITU-R BT.709)

### Print Process
- Frame-accurate composition using AVMutableComposition
- Professional timecode positioning with zero offset
- Segment insertion with proper timing rescaling
