Watch Folder System - Complete Rewrite:
- [FIXED] QuickLook crash in watch folder
  • Root cause: unsafeBitCast memory corruption in FSEvents C API
  • Solution: Migrated to FileMonitor library (https://github.com/aus-der-Technik/FileMonitor)
  • Result: Zero crashes, clean Swift code with async/await

- [FIXED] File detection issues
  • Move-in detection: Files moved into folder now properly imported
  • Batch delete detection: All deleted files detected (not just first one)
  • Smart change detection: Distinguishes new files vs modifications vs deletions
  • Handles macOS quirk where batch deletes report as "change" events

Watch Folder Feature Set (All Working):
  ✅ Copy files in → 3s debounce → auto-import
  ✅ Move files in → 3s debounce → auto-import
  ✅ Modify existing files → update metadata
  ✅ Delete single file → mark offline
  ✅ Delete multiple files → mark all offline
  ✅ QuickLook files → no crash
  ✅ Hidden file filtering (. prefix ignored)
  ✅ Video extension filtering (.mov, .mp4, .m4v, .mxf, .prores)
  ✅ VFX vs grade folder distinction

Technical Details:
  • Replaced FSEventStreamRef with FileMonitor library
  • Eliminated all unsafe C pointer code (unsafeBitCast, UnsafeRawPointer)
  • Async/await event consumption with MainActor for thread safety
  • Smart file existence checks to detect deletions reported as changes

VERSION MANAGEMENT:
- Semantic versioning implemented: v0.1.0
- Auto-incrementing build numbers (currently Build 9)
