## Build Instructions

- Build with `@build.sh` for CLI, let me handle building/running for error reporting
- Build GUI with `build-sourceprint.sh`

## ðŸŽ¯ TOP PRIORITY TODOS

### Critical Issues
- **Fix VFX printing**: VFX segments printing at wrong timecode position (should use actual VFX timecode anchor, not centering)
- **UI Preview Timeline**: Create visual timeline/graph showing segment placement for verification and debugging

## SwiftFFmpeg Print Process âœ…

**Production Status**: SwiftFFmpeg is the default print process for Premiere Pro compatibility
- **Performance**: 89% of AVFoundation speed with full Premiere Pro compatibility
- **Architecture**: Direct stream copying eliminates edit lists that cause Premiere Pro import errors
- **VFX Support**: Complete metadata flow from UI through to final output

## Core Architecture (Current Status)

### Current Technical Stack
- **ProRes 4444 Pipeline**: VideoToolbox hardware-accelerated encoding throughout
- **TimecodeKit Integration**: Frame-accurate calculations for all professional frame rates
- **Swift Package Architecture**: Shared Core engine between CLI and GUI
- **Feature-Based UI**: Modular SwiftUI components (ContentView.swift: 1276â†’51 lines)

## Core Features âœ…

### Processing Pipeline
- **Import**: Multithreaded media analysis with recursive directory support (3-4s vs 24s)
- **Linking**: Strict validation-based OCF-segment matching with professional timecode precision
- **Blank Rush**: Hardware-accelerated ProRes 4444 generation (180-240fps) with running timecode
- **Print Process**: SwiftFFmpeg-based composition with Premiere Pro compatibility

### SourcePrint GUI
- **Project Management**: .w2 JSON files with native macOS File menu integration
- **Professional UI**: Apple Compressor theming, render queue system, status tracking
- **Advanced Features**: Timeline preview, batch operations, modification detection

### Technical Standards
- **Frame Rates**: Full professional support (23.976-120fps, drop frame, etc.)
- **Quality**: ProRes 4444 pipeline, BT.709 color space, SMPTE timecode precision
- **Architecture**: Shared Core library, feature-based organization, reactive UI

## Critical Bug Fixes âœ…

### Frame Rate & Timecode Precision
- **Frame Rate Encoding**: Fixed 23.976fps precision using rational arithmetic instead of float calculations
- **Last Frame Accuracy**: Segments ending at timeline boundary now use timecode-based calculation instead of duration
- **SMPTE Support**: Professional drop frame and non-drop frame handling for all frame rates
- **Boundary Handling**: Fixed 59.94 DF clips ending exactly at OCF boundary

## Recent Feature Implementations âœ…

### Render Queue System
- **Professional Workflow**: NLE-style queue with batch operations, modification detection, and graceful stop control
- **Status Tracking**: Complete print history with automatic re-print flagging when segments change

### UI/UX Improvements
- **Typography**: SF Pro migration with monospaced digits for stable layouts
- **Linking Rules**: Strict validation-based matching with consumer camera detection and VFX exemptions
- **Apple Compressor Theming**: Professional purple accent with dark backgrounds
